            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi!<br>
            My name is Connor and I am originally from California in the United States. I am on my second year of teaching and I have been very excited on this journey. It gives me great pleasure to know that I am sharing my knowledge from my native language to connect people from around the world.</p>
            <p>Before I traveled here, I received a level-5 TEFL certification. I have been teaching students of all ages from kindergarten to sixth grade and Cambridge exam preparation classes from levels A2 to C1. I specialize in speaking and conversational practice as well as grammar and pronunciation refinement.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking, traveling, skiing, and going to music festivals. As far as traveling, I deeply enjoy going to new places and learning about many different cultures.</p>
